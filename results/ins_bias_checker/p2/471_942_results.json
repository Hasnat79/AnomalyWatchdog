Both of these situations are unusual as typically people would not be wearing gloves while preparing food or serving it to customers.\n\nAdditionally, there is a part of the video where people are seen standing in line to get food. It is a long line, and the people in it are waiting patiently. However, there is also a man in the restaurant who is wearing a yellow jacket. He is standing behind the other people in the line, but there is no explanation as to why he is there. It is just an odd sight that doesn't fit into the usual routine of people waiting in line at a restaurant.\n\nFinally, there is a part of the video where people are eating in a restaurant. There are many people eating together, and it seems to be a very social occasion. There are also several chairs and tables in the restaurant that are occupied by people.\n\nIn summary, there are several unusual scenes in the video. The man wearing gloves in the kitchen and the man wearing a yellow jacket behind the line are the most notable",
