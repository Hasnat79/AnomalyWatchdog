The other unusual activity is when a group of kids are playing a game of tennis in a backyard with no proper tennis court or equipment. It appears that they are playing the game with a ball and racket that they might not be familiar with. The video also shows a group of kids jumping in a pool, which is unusual as it seems they are not wearing proper swimming attire or life jackets.
